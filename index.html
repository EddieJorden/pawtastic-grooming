					<p>This year marks my final ride with the AIDS Lifecycle and
						I couldn't be more proud to have participated since 2014. 
						The 545 miles may be easy, but the real challenge is raising 
						$3500 in donations. Every dollar helps support crucial 
						research for people living with HIV and provides vital services 
						to those affected by the disease. The AIDS Lifecycle organization 
						does amazing work and I'm honored to have been a part of it. 
						If you're able to, please visit <span><a href="https://giving.aidslifecycle.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donate.participant&participantID=33335">aidslifecycle.org</a></span>. Every donation, 
						no matter how small, makes a difference and is tax-deductible. 
						Thank you for your support!
